# Interpreting the Eorzean Mega Arcana

Swami Sophie is not predictive.
It is diagnostic.

It reads patterns of influence through:

- structural forces (`Crystal`, `Divine`, `Calamity`)
- amplification and distortion (`Primal`, `Shard`)
- personal lens (`Persona`)
- behavioral manifestation (`Court`, `Element`)

## 1. Read the Scale First

Begin with `Scale`.

- `Minor` means the reading is centered on behavior or immediate expression.
- `Major` means the reading is centered on recurring pattern or structural pressure.
- `Era` means the reading is centered on transformation or overriding force.

Scale tells you how serious the pattern is before you interpret detail.

## 2. Read Era State

Era State describes direction of movement.

- `Astral` suggests outward push, assertion, or expansion.
- `Umbral` suggests withdrawal, compression, or consolidation.
- `Transitional` suggests instability, mediation, or rebalancing.

Era State also influences whether shadow meanings are emphasized.

## 3. Identify the Highest Authority Card

Interpret the draw through the doctrinal hierarchy:

1. `Calamity`
2. `Crystal`
3. `Divine`
4. `Primal`
5. `Shard`
6. `Persona`
7. `Court`
8. `Element`

Higher tiers frame the lower tiers beneath them. If a `Calamity` appears, it sets the dominant interpretive pressure even when other cards remain important.

## 4. Watch Escalation and Moderation

- `Escalation` suggests amplification, volatility, or strong movement.
- `Moderation` suggests containment, stabilization, or correction.

If both are present, the reading points toward tension between force and restraint.

## 5. Read the Dominant Element

Element describes how influence expresses itself.

- `Fire` — action
- `Ice` — control
- `Wind` — thought or movement
- `Earth` — structure
- `Lightning` — decision or revelation
- `Water` — relationship

Dominant Element is counted from both Element and Court cards.

## 6. Respect Position

### Aether Pulse

- `Pressure` — what is pushing on the situation
- `Axis` — the core pivot or organizing pressure
- `Direction` — where the current movement tends

### Convergence of the Star

- `First Row` — surface dynamic
- `Second Row` — underlying structure
- `Third Row` — outcome vector

Position is not ornamental. It defines where influence is operating.

## What This System Does Not Do

Swami Sophie does not:

- guarantee outcomes
- predict events with certainty
- replace judgment

It reveals patterns of influence and suggests how they are arranged.

## Final Principle

Read the system in order:

1. scale
2. era state
3. highest authority
4. escalation versus moderation
5. dominant element
6. position

This keeps the interpretation grounded in doctrine instead of isolated card impressions.
