# Interpreting the Eorzean Mega Arcana

Swami Sophie is not predictive.
It is diagnostic.

It reads patterns of influence through:

- structural forces (`Crystal`, `Divine`, `Calamity`)
- amplification and distortion (`Primal`, `Shard`)
- personal lens (`Persona`)
- behavioral manifestation (`Court`, `Element`)

## Start With the Header

Before reading any narrative text, look at the header.

The header tells you:

- how serious the pattern is (`Scale`)
- what direction the field is moving (`Era State`)
- how the pressure is likely to express itself (`Dominant Element`)
- whether force is intensifying (`Escalation`)
- whether the field is being corrected or contained (`Moderation`)

## 1. Read the Scale First

Begin with `Scale`.

- `Minor` means the reading is centered on behavior or immediate expression.
- `Major` means the reading is centered on recurring pattern or structural pressure.
- `Era` means the reading is centered on transformation or overriding force.

Scale tells you how serious the pattern is before you interpret detail.

## 2. Read Era State

Era State describes direction of movement.

- `Astral` suggests outward push, assertion, or expansion.
- `Umbral` suggests withdrawal, compression, or consolidation.
- `Transitional` suggests instability, mediation, or rebalancing.

Era State also affects how readily Shadow meanings are emphasized.

## 3. Identify the Highest Authority Card

Interpret the draw through the doctrinal hierarchy:

1. `Calamity`
2. `Crystal`
3. `Divine`
4. `Primal`
5. `Shard`
6. `Persona`
7. `Court`
8. `Element`

Higher tiers frame the lower tiers beneath them. If a `Calamity` appears, it sets the dominant interpretive pressure even when lower cards remain relevant.

## 4. Watch Escalation and Moderation

- `Escalation` suggests amplification, volatility, or strong movement.
- `Moderation` suggests containment, stabilization, or correction.

If both are present, the reading points toward tension between force and restraint.

## 5. Read the Dominant Element

Element describes how influence expresses itself.

- `Fire` — action
- `Ice` — control
- `Wind` — thought or movement
- `Earth` — structure
- `Lightning` — decision or revelation
- `Water` — relationship

Dominant Element is counted from both Element and Court cards. If there is no clear majority, it is left unset.

## 6. Respect Position

Position gives the draw shape.

### Aether Pulse

- `Pressure` — what is pushing on the situation
- `Axis` — the core pivot or organizing pressure
- `Direction` — where the current movement tends

### Convergence of the Star

- `First Row` — surface dynamic
- `Second Row` — underlying structure
- `Third Row` — outcome vector

Position is not ornamental. It defines where influence is operating.

## Interpretation Bias

Interpretation Bias is a tone filter, not a draw filter.

It never changes the cards. It only changes how strongly the narrative emphasizes the constructive side or the shadow side of those cards.

### Auto

Uses the normal contextual rules.

- if the field is tense, Umbral, or otherwise pressured, it may lean toward Shadow
- if the field is stable or more open, it may lean toward Core

Best when you want the system to decide naturally.

### PreferCore

Leans toward the constructive, solution-oriented side of the cards.

Use it when you want the reading framed toward action, repair, growth, or practical next steps.

### PreferShadow

Leans toward tension, blind spots, distortion, or risk.

Use it when you want to stress-test a situation or examine where the pressure is most likely to fail.

### StrictAuto

Uses Shadow only when the polarity logic actually requires it.

It removes the extra dramatic push that `Auto` can apply under severe pressure such as Calamity conditions.

Use it when you want the most restrained, analytical reading style.

## How Bias Interacts With Era State

Bias changes tone, but Era State still matters.

- `Astral` fields tend to support outward, clearer, more assertive readings.
- `Umbral` fields tend to support withdrawn, compressed, or more shadow-weighted readings.
- `Transitional` fields sit between those poles.

`StrictAuto` keeps that logic but removes the extra non-required dramatic push. `PreferCore` and `PreferShadow` intentionally override the default tonal lean.

## How to Read in Order

A stable reading method is:

1. read `Scale`
2. read `Era State`
3. identify the highest authority card or stratum
4. check `Escalation` and `Moderation`
5. note the `Dominant Element`
6. read the position meanings
7. only then read the narrative details

This keeps the interpretation grounded in doctrine instead of isolated card impressions.

## What This System Does Not Do

Swami Sophie does not:

- guarantee outcomes
- predict events with certainty
- replace judgment

It reveals patterns of influence and suggests how they are arranged.
