# Swami Sophie — Usage Guide

## Opening the Plugin

Use either:

- `/swami`
- `/ema`

This opens the main reading window.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Choose a Spread

Swami Sophie currently supports:

- `Aether Pulse` — 3-card spread. Best for focused questions or short-term dynamics.
- `Convergence of the Star` — 9-card spread. Best for complex, layered situations or long-term trajectories.

### 2. Enter a Question (Optional)

The question field is optional but recommended.

Good examples:

- `What is shaping this conflict?`
- `What should I understand before I act?`
- `What is the true pressure beneath this situation?`

Avoid yes/no questions. This is a diagnostic system, not a fortune engine.

### 3. Choose Output Mode

- `Concise`: core narrative and position summaries. Best for quick insight.
- `Layered`: structured breakdown across Cosmic Authority, Amplification & Distortion, Personal Lens, Manifestation, and Recommendation.
- `Scholarly`: includes the full layered output plus diagnostics such as polarity sum, scale determination, stratum counts, and element counts.

Use `Scholarly` when you want to understand why the engine concluded what it did.

### 4. Interpretation Bias

Interpretation Bias changes text emphasis only. It never changes the draw itself.

- `Auto` — contextual shadow selection.
- `PreferCore` — emphasizes constructive expressions.
- `PreferShadow` — emphasizes tension, warning, or distortion.
- `StrictAuto` — only polarity mismatch triggers shadow.

### 5. Draw

Click `Draw`.

If `Pin Draw` is enabled, the plugin will ask for confirmation before replacing an existing spread.

## Understanding the Header

Each reading begins with:

- `Scale`
  - `Minor` — personal or behavioral influence.
  - `Major` — structural or repeating influence.
  - `Era` — transformational or overriding force.
- `Era State`
  - `Astral` — outward movement or assertion.
  - `Umbral` — contraction or consolidation.
  - `Transitional` — instability or balancing pressure.
- `Dominant Element`
  - The most represented element across Element and Court cards.
  - Indicates how influence manifests.
- `Escalation`
  - Enabled when Primal or Calamity pressure is strong.
- `Moderation`
  - Enabled when Divine balancing influence stabilizes the field.

## Using the Deck Browser

The Deck Browser supports:

- search across card text
- filtering by Stratum
- filtering by Element
- filtering by Flags (`Override`, `Amplify`, `Distort`, `Moderate`)
- random card selection
- full card inspection

Use it for study, reference, and deck familiarization.

## History

The History window stores the most recent readings in a ring buffer.

You can:

- reopen a reading
- reinterpret it with a different output mode
- copy a prior reading
- export a prior reading

Optional persistence can be enabled in plugin settings.

## Exporting and Summary Output

- `Copy` — copies the current formatted reading.
- `Copy Summary` — copies a compact structured summary.
- `Export` — saves the reading as a timestamped text file.
